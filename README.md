## Heart-Disease-Prediction Website Project

## Project Overview:
The Heart-Disease-Prediction Website is an interactive web application that allows users to assess their risk of heart disease based on various input parameters. The project incorporates a Decision Tree machine learning algorithm implemented in Python to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided data. The website's front-end is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for data input and result display.

## Project Features:

1. **User Registration and Login:** Users can sign up for an account and log in to the website to access personalized features.

2. **Input Form:** The website presents users with a form where they can enter relevant information such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical history data.

3. **Data Validation:** JavaScript is used to perform client-side validation of the input data to ensure accuracy and completeness.

4. **Machine Learning Model:** Python's Decision Tree machine learning algorithm is used to analyze the input data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. The trained model is utilized to make predictions based on the user's data.

5. **Result Display:** The predicted outcome, i.e., whether the user is at low, moderate, or high risk of heart disease, is displayed on the website.

6. **Data Visualization:** The project incorporates data visualization techniques to display relevant graphs and charts, providing users with a better understanding of their health status.

7. **User Dashboard:** Registered users can access a personalized dashboard that stores their previous predictions and allows them to track their health progress over time.

8. **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technology Stack:

1. **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly a front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

2. **Back-end:** Python for implementing the Decision Tree algorithm, and possibly Flask or Django as the web framework.

3. **Data Processing and ML Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, or other relevant libraries for data processing and implementing the Decision Tree algorithm.

4. **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly, or other libraries for generating graphs and charts.

## Workflow:

1. The user visits the website and either logs in or creates a new account.

2. Upon successful login, the user is directed to the input form page.

3. The user enters their health-related data into the form.

4. The JavaScript code validates the input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.

5. The user submits the form, and the data is sent to the server-side (Python).

6. The Python backend processes the input data, performs predictions using the Decision Tree algorithm, and determines the user's risk of heart disease.

7. The results are sent back to the front-end, and the user is presented with their risk level along with relevant visualizations.

8. The results are also saved in the user's dashboard for future reference.

## Note: 
Since this is just a description of the project's content, specific code implementations and further details have not been included. Developing a functional Heart-Disease-Prediction Website with all the mentioned features would require substantial effort, including designing the user interface, implementing the decision tree algorithm, setting up the server, and handling data securely. The project will also need extensive testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Remember to keep user privacy in mind while handling sensitive medical data and comply with relevant data protection laws and regulations.
